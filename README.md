# Improving Learning Outcomes in Nigeria: Rethinking School as a Community and Community as a School

## Abstract
There is no clear way to analyze the problem of low educational outcomes in Nigeria. On the one hand, it does
appear to be a policy issue, and on the other hand, it seems, with an overwhelming prevalence, that the real
problem is a learning crisis. When it comes to education delivery in Nigeria, interventions, and policy design
especially in basic education have focused primarily on increasing enrollment. For instance, the Universal Basic
Education Board (UBEB) was specifically set up by President Olusegun Obasanjoâ€™s administration to increase the
number of primary school enrollments across the country (Ejere, 2011). But amidst all these policies, techniques
of education delivery, and the quality of learning have been completely overlooked. This paper aims to do a broad
systems analysis of education delivery in Nigeria, and more specifically examine the determinants of learning
quality in northern Nigeria where there is an ongoing conflict against formal/western education that is targeting
schools, students and displacing entire communities. Looking across the historical and institutional setup of the
Nigerian society, this paper also seeks to understand the many ways that community comes into play in the
education of a child and uses results from a project called Technology Enhanced for All (TELA) to suggest
bolstered demand-side integration that brings local and family-level factors to the core of the learning journeys of
students.
